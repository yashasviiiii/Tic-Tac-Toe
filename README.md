# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe Game
Overview:
This project is a simple terminal-based Tic Tac Toe game developed in Python. The game allows two players to compete by taking turns to place their marks ('X' and 'O') on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to align three marks in a row—either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—to win the game.

Features:
The Tic Tac Toe game includes a turn-based gameplay system where players alternate moves. The game ensures input validity by preventing moves outside the board or overwriting already occupied cells. Additionally, it features automatic win and draw detection, providing immediate feedback when a player wins or when the game ends in a draw.

How to Run:
To run the game, first clone the repository from GitHub using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/yashasviiiii/tic-tac-toe-python.git

Next, navigate to the project directory:

cd tic-tac-toe-python

Then, execute the game script with Python:

python tic_tac_toe.py

Gameplay Instructions
The board consists of a 3x3 grid. Players take turns entering their desired row and column to place their mark. The game continues until a player successfully aligns three marks or all cells are filled, resulting in a draw.

Technologies Used
The game is developed using Python, demonstrating basic programming and game development skills.
